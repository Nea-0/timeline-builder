Machine Learning Unfolded: A Timeline of Pioneering Achievements

This project presents a timeline of pioneering milestones in Machine Learning. Starting with the basic meaning of machine learning, it explores the earliest mathematical models of neurons and the groundbreaking Turing Test. It highlights Arthur Samuel’s checkers program as one of the first self-learning systems, the invention of the Perceptron, and the development of algorithms like k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN). The rise of Expert Systems in the 1970s–80s and IBM’s Deep Blue defeating Garry Kasparov in 1997 mark key turning points. Finally, the timeline concludes with the modern deep learning era, where neural networks and big data drive today’s AI breakthroughs.
